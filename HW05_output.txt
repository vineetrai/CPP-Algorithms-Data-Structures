16 items have been hashed
the tableSize is currently 31
the load factor is now 0.516129 >= 0.5
clearing the hash table and expanding tableSize...
63 % 3 == 0
65 % 3 == 2
65 % 4 == 1
65 % 5 == 0
67 % 3 == 1
67 % 4 == 3
67 % 5 == 2
67 % 6 == 1
67 % 7 == 4
67 % 8 == 3
67 % 9 == 4
found the smallest prime more than double the previous size
the new hash table has size 67
starting hashing process again
